# Privacy Policy for BreakRot

**Last Updated:** January 23, 2026

## Introduction
BreakRot ("we," "our," or "us") is a digital wellness application designed to help you manage screen time and build healthier usage habits. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and share information when you use the app.

## Information We Collect

### 1) App Usage Data (Usage Access)
We access Android Usage Stats to provide core features such as screen time summaries, monitored apps, daily limits, and break reminders. This includes:
- App names and package identifiers
- Time spent in each app
- App launch times and usage timestamps

**Important:** Usage data is processed and stored **locally on your device**. We do not upload raw usage stats to our servers.

### 2) Account & Profile Data (if you sign in)
If you sign in with Google, we store:
- Display name
- Email address
- User ID

This data is used for authentication and to associate your cloud data with your account.

### 3) App Settings & Preferences (local)
We store your preferences locally on your device, including:
- Monitored apps selection
- Daily limits
- Notification settings and sound selection
- Focus timer settings and history
- Language preference
- Onboarding status

### 4) Cloud Data (Firebase Firestore)
If signed in, we sync limited data to Firebase Firestore for backup and multi‑device access. This may include:
- Monitored apps configuration and limits
- Focus activities (description, duration, timestamp)
- Daily quest templates and streak data
- User goals
- User settings (daily limit, notifications, focus reminders, sound choice)
- Subscription status (if applicable)

### 5) Ads & Monetization
We use Google Mobile Ads (AdMob) to show interstitial and rewarded ads. AdMob may collect device identifiers and ad interaction data according to Google’s policies.

### 6) Help/Support Submissions
If you submit a help/support request, we store the content you provide and basic metadata (timestamp). In current builds, help requests are stored locally.

## How We Use Your Information
We use your information to:
- Show your screen time and usage summaries

- Save and display focus sessions and quests
- Provide account features and cloud sync (if signed in)

## Data Sharing
We do **not** sell your personal data. We may share data only with:

These providers process data under their own policies.
